## About
My personal website. The window design is inspired by the macintosh operating system.
It is also inspired like a Unix Bash Shell. The keyboard controls are exactly the same.
Check out the available commands.

##Purpose
This website serves as my personal resume. The command shell navigates to all my experiences and qualifications.
To get some first impressions of my work the website also displays some of the applications I designed and wrote.
